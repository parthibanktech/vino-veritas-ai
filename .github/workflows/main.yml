# --- CI/CD STRATEGY ---
# Why do we see "install" commands here if we use Docker?
# Jobs 1 & 2 are "Fast Feedback" jobs. They run in seconds to catch typos, broken tests, 
# and security flaws immediately without waiting for a full 5-10 minute Docker build.
# Job 3 (Docker) then verifies that the final production container is also sound.

  # 1. We use a GitHub Repository Secret named 'RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK_URL'.
  # 2. This URL is a private webhook provided by Render that excludes the need for login/password in Git.
  # 3. If the CI pass (jobs 1, 2 & 3), we 'curl' this secret URL to tell Render to pull the fresh code.
